### Hi, this is Cristhian Narvaez  ðŸ‘‹

I have experience as a software engineer, I led the technology area of a company and had projects and developers in charge, I have experience with technologies such as Python, Django, PHP, Laravel, AWS, Dynamo, CDK, Pulumi, MuleSoft, Apex Salesforce, PostgreSQL, MySQL and Git, and I am tech founder of [lateacher](https://lateacher.com.co) a project that seeks to eliminate the barriers of virtual education.

- Currently I'm software engineer at [Nubank](nu.com.co)
- I worked at [Bold.co](bold.co) as software engineer
- I worked at [Platzi](https://platzi.com/) as software engineer.
- I worked as Salesforce developer at Globant, there I learned and participated in projects with Mulesoft, Salesforce Apex, and Einstein Analytics from Salesforce.
- Before Globant, I worked for a couple of companies as backend developer, using technologies like PHP, Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, HTML5, CSS, Javascript.
- Since I learned about clean architecture, clean code, TDD, good practices, Devops, among others, I am in love with those good practices.
